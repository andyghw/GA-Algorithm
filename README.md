# GA-Algorithm(Knapsack problem)
Team member: Hanwen Guo&&Yizhe Liu
We chose the typical knapsack problem. For example, there are many bags and each of them has different value and weight. Given a limited max weight, we put these bags into our knapsack. So what is the biggest total value?

The project is composed of three parts below: 

First, the GA algorithm part which is used to solve the problem. 

Second, the unit tests part which are used to verify if the functions like selection, crossover or mutation works successfully. To run the unit tests, you have to add dependency of junit to the local lib.

Third, the interface part which I used Swing to make the input and result clearer. To run it, you need to run the MainFrame.java file.

Hope you appreciate my project.

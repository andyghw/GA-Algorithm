# GA-Algorithm
We chose the typical knapsack problem. For example, there are many bags and each of them has different value and weight. Given a limited max weight, we put these bags into our knapsack. So what is the biggest total value?

The project is composed of three parts below: 
First, the GA algorithm part which is used to solve the problem. 
Second, the unit tests part which are used to verify if the functions like selection, crossover or mutation works successfully.
Third, the interface part which I used Swing to make the input and result clearer.

Hope you appreciate my project.

Thank you,
